# Thothi_Botshelo_Water-Quality-of-Botswana-Dams  
 Thothi Botshelo Node Red Application
 
 The major objective of our application is to give spatial variations and background concentrations of selected physio â€“ chemical parameters found in rivers that overflow into major dams in Botswana. The application basically tracks water quality looking at variable parameters that include Ph, total dissolved solid, water temperature, variations in conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO) values, Chloride, Biochemical Oxygen Demands, Turbidity, Hardness, Nitrate, Sulphate, Phosphate, Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium etc. 

The rivers and Botswana dams are displayed on the map, and you could be able to generate the water quality report of those dams and rivers.The platfotms features weather forecast dashboard.

The platform made use of IBM technologies, IBM cloud service Node Red.Also the application is deployed on IBM cloud,the following link direct you are to our application
